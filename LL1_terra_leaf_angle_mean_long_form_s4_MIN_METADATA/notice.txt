ID: LL1_terra_leaf_angle_mean_long_form_s4
Name: LL1_terra_leaf_angle_mean_long_form_s4_dataset
Description: This dataset contains leaf angle measurements for several genetic variants (cultivars) of the sorghum plant. The measurements were measured over the course of 133 days. Each plot (site) contains a timeseries of leaf angle measurements (in normalized degrees taken over the 133 day period. The task is to predict the last leaf angle measurement of each plot/site.
